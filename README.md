How to use it

so after zapping the website with zap (you can find it in my repo) you know important file paths of the website target 

you target it like this:
C:\myprojloc>python sqli_scanner.py "https://website_name/importantfilepath?id=1"


example: 
C:\myprojloc>python sqli_scanner.py "https://archivewordz.fwh.is/database.php?id=1"

Do NOT scan or test websites without permission.

This tool is designed for ethical hacking, penetration testing training, and bug bounty practice under legal boundaries.

Websites can track your IP and log your actions. Always test responsibly
